            You don’t have to be a yogi, go to a fancy retreat, or do hours of hot yoga every day to get all these
            benefits. And forget the myth that you have to be ultra-flexible to do yoga.

            Yoga has been shown to offer physical benefits, including a stronger immune system, less inflammation, more
            energy, less chronic pain, stronger muscles, improved balance, and better heart health.

            The truth is that yoga is one of the most accessible types of exercise for people of all ages, fitness
            levels, and stages of life—from pregnant women to the elderly.

            <p>Yoga reduced Covid stress: IIT-D study says <br>

                Yoga practitioners had “lower stress, anxiety and depression” during the lockdown imposed due to the
                Covid-19 outbreak last year as compared to non-practitioners, an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)
                Delhi study has found.</p>
            <p>The experts suggest that since Covid-19 affects the lungs directly, it is imperative to strengthen the
                lungs. The exercises and yoga asanas suggested by the experts help in reaching ideal saturation level,
                oxygenation and restore lung function. The breathing exercises also help in blood circulation and making
                one feel active during this monotonous time.<br>
                Yogasanas which involve abdominal, thoracic and clavicular breathing effectively help in gaining control
                of the breath, rectify breathing habits and increase the intake of oxygen. The asanas whether standing,
                sitting, or lying not only strengthen the back, thigh and stomach muscles but also increase oxygenation
                and lung capacity. If practiced regularly, these asanas help in refining breathing by lengthening the
                inhalation and exhalation process, improve the lung muscles, and also help in treating various
                respiratory disorders like cough and cold, sinus, asthma, etc.

                                and hence is aptly called the yogic breath of fire. Sit in vajrasana or sukhasana
                                (cross-legged

                                and close your fists.

                                If you suffer from hypertension and panic disorders, then do it under the supervision of
