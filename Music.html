            We know it's hard for you right now, never in a millon<br> year we thought
            something like this would happen and we will find ourselves as helpless as
            we are right now but you know what, life IS like this, and there's only one thing we can
            still do, we can live in the moment
            enjoying every ounce of it. We are stuck in this labyrinth so might as well enjoy
            it for now.<br>
